        <p>
            Hello everyone and welcome to my profile. My name is Enzo Poggioli, I am a first year student at the PGE (programme grande ecole) of EMLV situated in La Defense. I am a serious student who also likes to spend time with his friends. I came to this business school after spending a few years in the United States with my family. It allowed me to master my level in English in a decent way, and I was able to make friends that I still keep today. My group of friends is quite international or made up of people who have been expatriates, as I have spent a good part of my life abroad. Today I live in the Paris area and I work on the side to make money to travel and enjoy with all my friends.

        <h1 class="title title-green">soccer</h1>

        <p>
            Soccer is one of my passions. I practice it very regularly with my friends and we form teams. Sometimes we can't get to 11 in a team but we still play. I would like to play soccer every weekend but it is not possible. But I watch a lot of soccer games on TV, both big and small event. I sometimes bet on the outcome of the game to make it more exciting. In any case, I always enjoy playing soccer, which is a sport that I really enjoy and love from the bottom of my heart. Without soccer, I don't think life would have the same flavor!
